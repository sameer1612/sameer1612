Hi there! Since we don't know each other well yet, let me introduce myself and in turn, you can ping me via any of the media I laid out in the contact section. I am a Solutions Engineer, a phase by which I mean, being geared towards solving real-world problems irrespective of any technology or infrastructure bias. 

A minimalist and goal-oriented person, who can stand up and take responsibilities proactively right from day one. I have worked in the domain of web and mobile application development but open to all and have got my hands in few other interesting areas too. 

Also, mentorship and tech blogging is my hobby of pride, I always learnt by teaching and keep refining over time to help others while strengthening my roots. Have a look at my skill set and feel free to have a chat if our paths overlap somewhere. 😊

❤️ I love Coding, Travelling and Teaching.

😇 Call me world's happiest engineer.
