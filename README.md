- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Since we don't know each other, let me introduce myself and in turn, you can ping me via any of the media I laid out in the last section. I am a Solutions Engineer, a phase by which I mean, being geared towards solving real-world problems irrespective of any technology or infrastructure bias. A minimalist and goal-oriented person, who can stand up and take responsibilities proactively right from day one. I have worked in the domain of web and mobile application development but open to all and have got my hands in few other interesting areas. Also, mentorship is my hobby of pride, I always learnt by teaching and keep refining over time to help others while strengthening my roots.
